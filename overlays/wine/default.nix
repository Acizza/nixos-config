  #
  # Notes for updating:
  #
  # The wine and wine-staging versions should match the submodules on the GE repository.
  # 
  # How to update the Proton GE patchset:
  # 1. copy contents of https://github.com/GloriousEggroll/proton-ge-custom/blob/master/patches/protonprep.sh
  #    to the `protonprep` variable
  # 2. remove everything in the prep section of the `protonprep` variable before the wine staging part
  # 2. move all (or groups of) `git revert` calls in the protonprep script to a new `revert-hashes` file
  # 3. run gen-reverts.sh script
  # 4. copy contents of `generated-reverts` file to the places where the `git reverts` were originally
